# Template Directory

Here are listed all templates. 
The mia-* are the default ones
You can add more templates mounting a config map for that container at the directory /home/node/app/templates
Please remember to check the flag Preserve files and directories already existing in the Runtime Mount Path directory and don't use mia- prefix for the file name

This is just some example
